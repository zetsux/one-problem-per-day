Anton's favourite geometric figures are regular polyhedrons. Note that there are five kinds of regular polyhedrons:

-   Tetrahedron. Tetrahedron has 4 triangular faces.
-   Cube. Cube has 6 square faces.
-   Octahedron. Octahedron has 8 triangular faces.
-   Dodecahedron. Dodecahedron has 12 pentagonal faces.
-   Icosahedron. Icosahedron has 20 triangular faces.

All five kinds of polyhedrons are shown on the picture below:

Anton has a collection of n polyhedrons. One day he decided to know, how many faces his polyhedrons have in total. Help Anton and find this number!

## Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of polyhedrons in Anton's collection.

Each of the following n lines of the input contains a string si — the name of the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection. The string can look like this:

-   "Tetrahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a tetrahedron.
-   "Cube" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a cube.
-   "Octahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an octahedron.
-   "Dodecahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is a dodecahedron.
-   "Icosahedron" (without quotes), if the i-th polyhedron in Anton's collection is an icosahedron.

## Output

Output one number — the total number of faces in all the polyhedrons in Anton's collection.

## Examples

### Sample Input 1

    4
    Icosahedron
    Cube
    Tetrahedron
    Dodecahedron

### Sample Output 1

    42

### Sample Input 2

    3
    Dodecahedron
    Octahedron
    Octahedron

### Sample Output 2

    28

## Note

In the first sample Anton has one icosahedron, one cube, one tetrahedron and one dodecahedron. Icosahedron has 20 faces, cube has 6 faces, tetrahedron has 4 faces and dodecahedron has 12 faces. In total, they have 20 + 6 + 4 + 12 = 42 faces.

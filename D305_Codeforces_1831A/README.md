You are given a permutation† a of length n.

Find any permutation b of length n such that a1 + b1 ≤ a2 + b2 ≤ a3 + b3 ≤ … ≤ an + bn.

It can be proven that a permutation b that satisfies the condition above always exists.

†A permutation of length n is an array consisting of n distinct integers from 1 to n in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (n = 3 but there is 4 in the array).

## Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a single integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 2000) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the length of permutations a
and b.

The second line of each test case contains n distinct integers a1,a2,…,an (1 ≤ ai ≤ n) — the elements of permutation a. All elements of a are distinct.

Note that there is no bound on the sum of n over all test cases.

## Output

For each test case, output any permutation b which satisfies the constraints mentioned in the statement. It can be proven that a permutation b that satisfies the condition above always exists.

## Example

### Sample Input 1

    5
    5
    1 2 4 5 3
    2
    1 2
    1
    1
    3
    3 2 1
    4
    1 4 3 2

### Sample Output 1

    1 2 4 3 5
    2 1
    1
    1 2 3
    1 2 3 4

## Note

In the first test case a = [1,2,4,5,3]. Then the permutation b=[1,2,4,3,5] satisfies the condition because 1 + 1 ≤ 2 + 2 ≤ 4 + 4 ≤ 5 + 3 ≤ 3 + 5.

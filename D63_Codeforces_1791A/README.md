# A. Codeforces Checking

Source : [Problem](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1791/A)

- time limit per test 1 second
- memory limit per test 256 megabytes
- input standard input
- output standard output

Given a lowercase Latin character (letter), check if it appears in the string codeforces.

## Input

The first line of the input contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 26) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a character c — a single lowercase Latin character (letter).

## Output

For each test case, output "YES" (without quotes) if c satisfies the condition, and "NO" (without quotes) otherwise.

You can output the answer in any case (for example, the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes" and "YES" will be recognized as a positive answer).

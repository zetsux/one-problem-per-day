Given an array a of length n, you can do at most k operations of the following type on it:

- choose 2 different elements in the array, add 1 to the first, and subtract 1 from the second. However, all the elements of a have to remain non-negative after this operation.

What is lexicographically the smallest array you can obtain?

An array x is lexicographically smaller than an array y if there exists an index i such that xi < yi, and xj = yj
for all 1 ≤ j < i. Less formally, at the first index i in which they differ, xi < yi.

## Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 ≤ t ≤ 20) — the number of test cases you need to solve.

The first line of each test case contains 2 integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10000) — the number of elements in the array and the maximum number of operations you can make.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, …, an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100) — the elements of the array a.

## Output

For each test case, print the lexicographically smallest array you can obtain after at most k
operations.

## Example

### Sample Input 1

    2
    3 1
    3 1 4
    2 10
    1 0

### Sample Output 1

    2 1 5
    0 1

## Note

In the second test case, we start by subtracting 1 from the first element and adding 1 to the second. Then, we can't get any lexicographically smaller arrays, because we can't make any of the elements negative.

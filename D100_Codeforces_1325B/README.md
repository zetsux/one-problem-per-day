Ehab has an array a of length n. He has just enough free time to make a new array consisting of n copies of the old array, written back-to-back. What will be the length of the new array's longest increasing subsequence?

A sequence a is a subsequence of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements. The longest increasing subsequence of an array is the longest subsequence such that its elements are ordered in strictly increasing order.

## Input

The first line contains an integer t — the number of test cases you need to solve. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) — the number of elements in the array a.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, …, an (1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9) — the elements of the array a.

The sum of n across the test cases doesn't exceed 10^5.

## Output

For each testcase, output the length of the longest increasing subsequence of a if you concatenate it to itself n times.

## Example

### Sample Input 1

    2
    3
    3 2 1
    6
    3 1 4 1 5 9

### Sample Output 1

    3
    5

## Note

In the first sample, the new array is [3,2,1,3,2,1,3,2,1]. The longest increasing subsequence is marked in bold.

In the second sample, the longest increasing subsequence will be [1,3,4,5,9].

You are given three digits 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐. Two of them are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Find the value that occurs exactly once.

## Input

The first line contains a single integer 𝑡 (1≤𝑡≤270) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 (0 ≤ 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 ≤ 9). Two of the digits are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

## Output

For each test case, output the value that occurs exactly once.
